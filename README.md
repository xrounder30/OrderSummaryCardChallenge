Solution of the Order Summary Card challenge from Frontend Mentor

As a web development self-taught newbie, this task perfectly led me how to properly use HTML and CSS, gave me a basic idea on how to start a web development project.

What I learnt:
Know how to organize HTML simply with the basic structure and to style in CSS, especially the flex, margin and padding. 

Difficulties:
Since it's my first task after self-taught lessons, I had no idea how and what to code in the beginning, more in CSS.
